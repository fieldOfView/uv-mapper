UV Mapper Tools
===============
http://fieldofview.com/projects/uv-mapper

The UV Mapper Tools provide an alternative to classic projection mapping animation and calibration techniques, but the tools can also be used for other purposes such as lens corrections for video. 

#### apps
UV Player and UV Tool are native applications for OS X and Windows, leveraging OpenGL to apply UV mapping techniques in real time using the GPU for processing. These applications are based on the Cinder framework, and rely on Apple's Quicktime for video playback. 

#### pixel bender
An Adobe Pixel Bender kernel which can be used to apply UV Maps to video content in Adobe After Effects. Given sufficiently capable hardware, the Pixel Bender kernel is executed on the GPU.

#### quartz composer
A Quartz Composer patch which can be used to apply UV Maps to video content inside Quartz Composer or other environments that support Quartz compositions.
