UV Mapper Tools: Quartz Composer
================================
http://fieldofview.com/projects/uv-mapper

The UV Mapper Tools were created to provide an alternative to classic projection mapping animation and calibration techniques, but the tools can also be used for other purposes such as lens corrections for video. 

A Quartz Composer patch which can apply a UV Map to an image inside a Quartz Composition or inside any host capable of displaying Quartz Compositions, such as VDMX and/or CoGe, or even Safari. The UV Mapper patch is implemented as a Core Image kernel, running without additional plugin requirements.

How to use
----------
The UV Mapper patch in the composition requires an image to be transformed, and a 16 bit UV Map. It is important that the provided map is imported with the "Disable Color Correction" option turned on, whereas the image itself must be color-corrected on import.

If you use the software regularly, you may consider making a donation so I can afford to continue making these plugins and making them available. If you use the source code in a commercial application, and/or bundle such software with a hardware product, I would love to receive a copy or unit. But again this is not a requirement.
