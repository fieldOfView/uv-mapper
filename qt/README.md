UV Mapper Tools: Mapper Tool
============================
http://fieldofview.com/projects/uv-mapper

The UV Mapper Tools were created to provide an alternative to classic projection mapping animation and calibration techniques, but the tools can also be used for other purposes such as lens corrections for video. 

The main tools suite uses Qt, OpenCv and OpenGl and supports Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
The Mapper Tool is a collaboration between fieldOfView and Z25.org

#### Mapper Tool
The Mapper Tool is used to create and edit UV maps for use with the UV Player. It is geared towards creating calibrated projections on arbitrary geometry, using a structured light scan of the projected surface.

If you use the software regularly, you may consider making a donation so I can afford to continue making these plugins and making them available. If you use the source code in a commercial application, and/or bundle such software with a hardware product, I would love to receive a copy or unit. But again this is not a requirement.
